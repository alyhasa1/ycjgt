# YCJGT Chatbot UI — Feb 10, 2025

## What was built
Premium chat-style UI page for youcanjustgeneratethings.com with an auto-playing demo loop showcasing the storyboard generation workflow inside a ChatGPT/Claude-style chat interface.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS v4
- Framer Motion (minimal, smooth animations)
- Lucide React icons

## Files
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Root layout with Inter font, metadata, favicon
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Fixed h-screen page with sidebar + chat
- `src/app/globals.css` — Global styles, color tokens, glassmorphism, animations
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — cn() utility
- `src/components/sidebar.tsx` — Icon-only sidebar with glass panel (pure CSS, no Framer)
- `src/components/chat-demo.tsx` — Complete chat UI with built-in demo loop
- `next.config.ts` — Unsplash remote image patterns

## Design
- **Fixed page** — `h-screen overflow-hidden`, no page scroll
- **Idle state** — Animated logo (floating + subtle rotate), word-by-word animated "You Can Just Generate Things..." (capitalized)
- **Chat messages** — User message (right) with asset thumbnails, AI response (left) with storyboard table inside chat bubble
- **Video card** — After storyboard, shows generated video preview with play overlay, Download/Share buttons, and "Start Over" CTA
- **Input bar** — Frosted glass, pinned at bottom with Attach/Storyboard/Send buttons (all blue, no orange)
- **Storyboard** — Appears as AI chat response, not as separate UI section
- **Scrolling** — Chat area scrolls top-to-bottom like a real chat, auto-scrolls to latest content

## Color Palette (updated — no orange)
- Primary Cyan: `#4FC3F7`
- Primary Dark: `#039BE5`
- Secondary: `#81D4FA`
- Accent (was orange, now): `#90CAF9`
- Deep Blue/Navy: `#0D1B3E`
- Ice Blue: `#E1F5FE`
- Background: `#F0F4F8`

## Demo Loop Phases
idle → dropping → sending → typing → storyboard → approving → generating → done → **video** → resetting (loops)

## Session 2 Changes (Feb 10)
- Added video card phase with preview thumbnail, play overlay, duration badge, title, Download/Share buttons
- Added "Start Over" CTA with pulsing animation at bottom of video card
- Replaced all orange/gold (#FFB300) with lighter blue (#90CAF9) across globals.css, sidebar, chat-demo
- Animated idle title "You Can Just Generate Things..." word-by-word with staggered delays, capitalized
- Removed sphere/orb around logo — logo now floats and subtly rotates directly
- Send button changed from orange gradient to blue gradient
- Bot avatar changed from accent/orange to primary blue
- Progress bar gradient changed from primary→accent to primary→secondary
- Improved auto-scroll timing for video card phase (450ms delay)

## Session 3 Changes (Feb 10)
- **Storyboard redesigned** — removed fancy glassmorphic card, now a clean native `<table>` like ChatGPT/Claude conversation output with scene name, description, duration, transition columns
- **Demo is CTA-triggered** — added "See How It Works" button on idle screen; demo no longer auto-plays
- **Loop removed** — demo stops at video card phase; "Replay Demo" button lets user manually restart
- **Sidebar hidden on mobile** — `hidden md:flex` on `<aside>`, main content `ml-0 md:ml-[72px]`
- **Sidebar logo simplified** — removed blue gradient background (`bg-gradient-to-br from-primary to-primary-dark shadow-lg`), logo now plain with no background
- **Overall polish** — cleaner message bubbles (smaller avatars, subtler backgrounds), simplified input bar (ghost-style buttons, icon-only send), less visual noise
- **AI response copy** — added intro text "Here's your storyboard..." and closing "Total duration: 22 seconds. Ready to generate?" for natural conversation feel
- **Mobile responsive** — padding and font sizes adjust for small screens

## Session 4 Changes (Feb 10)
- **Real fashion assets** — replaced 5 Unsplash placeholders with 4 local images (`/image1.png` through `/image4.png`): editorial look, layered outfit, minimal knit, chain bag
- **Real video output** — video card now uses native `<video>` element with actual generated video from `upload.salemate.app`, poster set to `image1.png`, browser-native controls
- **Fashion storyboard scenes** — descriptions updated to match fashion content (editorial opening, layered reveal, minimal texture, product close-up)
- **Metadata updated** — 4 scenes, 18 seconds total, title "Fashion Lookbook — Generated"
- **next.config.ts cleaned** — removed Unsplash/Picsum `remotePatterns` (no longer needed with local images + native `<video>`)

## Notes
- The `@theme` CSS lint warning is expected — it's TailwindCSS v4 syntax
- Dev server: `npx next dev` from ycjgt-app directory
- Removed old components: hero-section, quick-actions, ambient-particles, glassmorphic-orb, demo-loop, storyboard-table, input-bar
